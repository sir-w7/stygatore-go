Stygatore is a metaprogramming tool aiming at language-agnostic code generation for generics programming. The code is kept as simple as possible to achieve this goal. Accordingly, performance and memory usage are key considerations in programming the system. This is intended to be a clean, maintainable, performant, and minimal codebase.

Note that this is the **Go version** of the original C++ codebase for sanity reasons, specifically in solving cross-platform multithreading with goroutines.
